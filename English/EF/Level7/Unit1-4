[TODD]  Hey, Joan! How was the conference?
[JOAN]  Fascinating. I saw a very different idea of the future. And I think it will be good for business.
[TODD]  How do you mean?
[JOAN]  You know how so many people are pessimistic about the future.
[TODD]  Yeah. It can be a little scary sometimes.
[JOAN]  Well, all the speakers at the conference were optimistic. For them, the future's incredible.
[TODD]  That's great, I suppose. But is it realistic?
[JOAN]  I think so. The speakers talked about how technology is improving the lives of people in the developing word.
[JOAN]  Cellphones have brought better communication, and people are getting computers.
[TODD]  And computers need software.
[JOAN]  Exactly. Africa will be a huge market for us soon.
[TODD]  It will.
[JOAN]  I also saw a demonstration of some technology that would be great for us.
[TODD]  Really? What was it?
[JOAN]  The latest teleconferencing technology. 
        We did a call with Tokyo, and it would like they were in the room with us.
[TODD]  It would be wonderful to have that here.
[JOAN]  Yeah. We could have more effective meetings with Sunset Computers in New York.
[TODD]  Or with Lindstorm in Sweden. Fewer long business trips.
[JOAN]  Exactly what I was thinking.

Buying new teleconferencing equipment isn't realistic. We don't have the money right now.
Oue market share in Europe and North America is good. Now we need to sell more in the developing word.
Can you demonstrate how the new software works?
Soon, all business will communicate by teleconference. No more plane trips!
China is our of our most important markets.
Teleconferencing technology allows us to have very effective meetings.

Africa will be a huge market for us in the future.  //  未来，非洲将成为我们的巨大市场。
The conference on technology was excellent.         //  探讨科技的会议开得很好。
For a teleconference, you need a large-screen TV.   //  如果想举行电话会议，你需要一个大屏幕电视机。
New markets are opening in the developing word.     //  正在发展中国家打开新的市场。
Mark demonstrated some new, effective technology.   //  马克演示了一些效果很不错的新技术。

用 fewer 加可数名词复数说明某件事物数量的减少。可数名词是可以与数字一起使用的名词。

She has fascinating ideas for the future.
One person said that he was very worried.
They talked about the developing world.
Some people seem pessimistic.
They believe that technology will improve.

1. The speakers at the Bright Ideas conference last year gave optimistic ideas about the future. I liked what Henrik 
Mayer said. He believes that technology will provide more health services to people who live far from hositals. If 
a sick person has a mobile phone, the doctors will use teleconferencing technology to help sick people by phone, the 
doctors will use teleconferencing technology to help sick people by phone. This seems realistic, and it will help 
people have fewer health problems in the future.
2. I read a university report that said that developing contries, the US and Europe strongly disagree about pollution 
laws. The report said that developing contries will create more pollution than other countries because they have fewer 
laws about air and water quality. The report is very pessimistic, but I think it is also very realistic. I believe that 
word leaders need to meet and discuss this, or we will have terrible environmental problems.
3. A German CEO says that Africa will be a huge market for computer business. The CEO believes that Africa economies 
will grow by 100% by the year 2050. I am also optimistic about Africa, but it's not realistic the economy will grow 
100% in such a short time. Africa needs fewer laws that hurt business before the economy will grow so quickly.
