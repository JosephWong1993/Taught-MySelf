[KATE] Work experience?
[KATE] Um, none.
[KATE] To be honest, this is my first job interview.
[NINA] So what are your career goals?
[KATE] Career goals?
[NINA] You know - what are you interested in?
[KATE] Oh.
[KATE] Well, I haven't really thought about that.
[KATE] Something in fashion, that's for sure. Well, first I just need to get some more work experience.
[NINA] Okay. So, what are some of your strengths?
[KATE] I'm great with people, I'm hardworking and I'm a quick leaner.
[NINA] Joe.
[NINA] Checked his references ...
[NINA] His boss says he's lazy and has been pretty unreliable.
[NINA] And then there's Rebecca.
[NINA] Oh! I mean, Ms. Calton.
[NINA] She's got sales experience, but she is inflexible and a bit unfriendly.
[NINA] And Kate.
[NINA] Nice girl.
[NINA] I really liked her, but no work experience and no career goals.
[NINA] I'm afraid I'm going to have to start over and look for more applicants.

to be honest

To be honest, I don't have a lot of work experience.
What would you say is one of your biggest strengths?
I don't have a lot of work experience, but I'm a quick leaner.
He included three references with his resume.
We need someone who isn't so inflexible.
I've already interviewed six applicants for the position.

[EMMA] I was so nervous!
[EMMA] I mean, at the job interview last week.
[EMMA] When I arrived at the office, I was told to wait in this big room.
[EMMA] All the other people who were there to apply for the job, all the other candidates, were waiting in this room. 
       Fifty or more people and not a work was spoken.
[EMMA] Anyway, finally it was my turn.
[EMMA] There were three interviewers.
[EMMA] They asked a lot of questions.
[EMMA] A man who looked like the boss asked the most difficult ones.
[EMMA] One question, which I had no idea how to answer, was about me.
[EMMA] 'Why did I think I was suitable for the job?' I hate those kinds of questions.
[EMMA] Anyway, I got the job.
[EMMA] That's the important thing.
[EMMA] I was given the chance.
[EMMA] I'm going to work for an organization called Houses for Homeless.
[EMMA] Last year, more than 10,000 people were given homes by this organization.
[EMMA] I'll start off in the office but, after a few years, who knows?
[EMMA] One step at a time, though, right?
