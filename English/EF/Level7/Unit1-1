[JOAN]  I didn't realize that the city changed to natural gas from coal last month.
[TODD]  Yes. And I'm all for it. Less pollution, better air quality. 
        Water quality has been improving recently, too.
[JOAN]  Speaking of the environment, AI and I are thinking about buying an electric car. 
        We were looking at some online last night.
[TODD]  Really? That's a great idea! Perfect for commuting. And they're getting cheaper fast.
[JOAN]  Apparently, the new ones can go up to 170 kilometers between charges.
[TODD]  I didn't know that. Angela and I looked at our monthly expenses recently.
        Can you believe we're spending almost 200 dollars a month on gasoline?
[JOAN]  I believe it. Gas just keeps getting more expensive. That's why we're thinking about an electric car.
        They cost just a few cents a kilometer to run.
[TODD]  If you get one, I'd love to try it out.
[JOAN]  Sure.

City Builds Electric Car Charging Stations
By Tarana Anand
People can now charge their electric cars in the city parking lot.
"We've built two charging stations for electric cars," said city engineer Randolph Schmidt. "If people use more 
clean electricity for cars and less dirty gasoline, we can decrease air pollution."
Alma Torres commutes 80 kilometers a day to her bank job in her electric car. "The city charging station are 
wonderful. They show that the city cares about saving the environment around us," she said.
The city is also serious about improving water and air quality, Schmidt said. Last year, the city stopped using 
coal. Now, natural gas powers all city buildings.

Natural gas powers all city buildings.                  //  城市中所有的建筑物都用上了天然气。
We've stopped using coal.                               //  我们已不用煤炭。
I care about the environment.                           //  我关注环境。
If we use electricity for cars, pollution decreases.    //  如果汽车用电作为动力，污染就会减轻。
I commute 50 kilometers a day.                          //  我每天上下班50公里。
People charge electric cars at charging stations.       //  人们在充电站为电动汽车充电。
