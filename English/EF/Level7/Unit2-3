[SIMON] Jake, what's wrong? You haven't said anything for an hour.
[JAKE]  It's my job again, managing the coffee shop.
[SIMON] Did something happen at work?
[JAKE]  No. Nothing happened at work. That's the point. Nothing ever happens. It's completely unchallenging. 
        The same boring stuff, every day.
[SIMON] Why not change your job?
[JAKE]  Like it's that easy.
[SIMON] Well, what other jobs have you got experience in?
[JAKE]  Well, I was a substitute teacher for a couple of months. I really enjoyed that.
[SIMON] That was last year, right?
[JAKE]  Yeah. It was really rewarding.
[SIMON] That's great.
[JAKE]  The kids actually learned some history. At least, I think they did. Anyway, I loved it.
[SIMON] That's great.
[JAKE]  It's always been my dream to become a teacher. If I were a teacher, I'd be a lot happier with my life.
[SIMON] What do you have to do to become a teacher.
[JAKE]  Well, first I have to ... I need a teaching certificate.
[SIMON] So you need to take some classes. You can do that.
[JAKE]  Well, actually, there's a certificate program in January. I'm hoping to get on it. 
[SIMON] That's great, Jake. You really have a plan to change your life. 
[JAKE]  I guess I do. Of course, working during the day and studying at night ... well, it won't be easy. 
[SIMON] Lots of people do it.
[JAKE]  Hey. Wanna play Galaxy Battlestar.
[SIMON] Un, okay.

Dear Mon and Dad，
This is a very exciting time for me. I'll be graduating next month with my degree in engineering. Dad, I know it's your dream for me to get 
a job with a big engineering company. Honestly, I'm just not sure that's what I want to do. Mom, I know you're hoping that Julie and I will 
get married, but it's not the right time. Maybe in a year or two. 
My dream is to see the world and use my degree to help people. That's why I'm applying to Peace Corps. I hope that I can make a difference 
in some people's lives. If the Peace Corps accepts me, I'd like to work on water project. People need clean water.
Well, I guess that's it for now. Thank you both for all your help. Talk to you soon.
Love,
Tim
