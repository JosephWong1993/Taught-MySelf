[SIMON] Thank you for coming. I know you're both busy.
[TODD]  No problem.
[SIMIN] As you both know, innovation is critical for our future success. We have to keep getting better.
[JOAN]  You sound worried.
[SIMON] I am. We're in a competitive industry. 
[TODD]  True.
[SIMON] And unless we innovate constantly, we can't stay competitive.
[JOAN]  Where are we going with this, Simon?
[SIMON] Well, I'm talking about time. In order to develop new and better products, our developers need downtime.
[TODD]  You're saying that your developers are just too busy.
[SIMON] Exactly, We're working all day, every day, just so that we can hit our deadlines.
[JOAN]  Aren't we all? What do you propose?
[SIMON] I want to hire one more senior engineer. Then, we keep Friday afternoons for the engineers, just to talk 
        to each other. It could be really informal.
[JOAN]  Four hours? Just to talk?
[SIMON] Yes, to talk. To share ideas. To brainstorm. To be creative. It would make a huge difference.
[JOAN]  Ummm, what do you think, Todd?
[TODD]  I like it ... If we have the time to do it.
[JOAN]  Tell you what. Why don't you take, um, two hours this Friday and, uh, see how it goes?
[SIMON] Uh, thanks.
