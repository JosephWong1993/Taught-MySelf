[NANCY] So what are we going to do?
[NANCY] Let's look at your choices.
[NANCY] If you get a job now, you will make money soon.
[NANCY] But if you go to law school and become a lawyer, you will make a lot of money later.
[NANCY] And if you join the Peace Corps ...
[NANCY] ... I won't make money ...
[EMMA]  ... ever!
[BOB]   Peace Corps?
[BOB]   Emma?
[BOB]   You're thinking about the Peace Corps?
[NANCY] Yes, Emma is going to apply.
[BOB]   Emma.
[EMMA]  Dad, I just want to do something good.
[EMMA]  You gave me so much, and I'm so grateful.
[EMMA]  But now I want to go out there.
[EMMA]  I want to help people.
[EMMA]  I think if I join the Peace Corps, I'll really help people.
[EMMA]  I'll give something back.
[NANCY] It's a really noble idea, Em.
[BOB]   I know kids grow up.
[BOB]   They move out of the house, they get jobs, they get married.
[BOB]   But she's talking about the Peace Corps.
[BOB]   She will be so far away.
[BOB]   But she will help people.
[BOB]   If she moves abroad, she will learn another language.
[BOB]   She'll get to see a lot of things and meet a lot of new people - yeah.
[BOB]   But it's dangerous.
[BOB]   She'll be far away, and I won't see her for two years.
[BOB]   I'll worry so much.
[BOB]   Why don't you just stay here with me?
[BOB]   With us?
[EMMA]  Well, I don't know yet.
[EMMA]  My future is, um, undecided.
