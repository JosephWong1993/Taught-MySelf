[SIMON] Pam! Just the person I wanted to talk to.
[PAM]   Hey, Simon. What's up?
[SIMON] Well, I'm curious about something. How long did you work at Sunset Computers?
[PAM]   Um, three years. Why?
[SIMON] You read the announcement about us buing them, right?
[PAM]   Uh, yeah.
[SIMON] Well, I wanted to get your thoughts on a few things.
[PAM]   Sure. Go ahead.
[SIMON] So, I've been working with the engineers over at Sunset, and I think that they're 
        first rate. They really know what they're doing. But I'm having a lot of trouble 
        with middle management.
[PAM]   I'm really not surprised to hear that.
[SIMON] Why?
[PAM]   Well, when I was there, employee morale is really low. Some of the managers were 
        incompetent. And the communication between management and staff was terrible.
[SIMON] Really?
[PAM]   Yeah. And thins got even worse after the CEO Left.
[SIMON] I can imagine.
[PAM]   Simon, can I be honest with you?
[SIMON] Of course.
[PAM]   The lower-level staff at Sunset are great, and so are the products. 
        But I really think the only solution is to replace the management team.
[SIMON] That's pretty radical.
[PAM]   Yeah, but it's the only way to solve the problem.
[SIMON] I appreciate your honesty. I'm gonna have to think about this.

The Clayton Harelson Company made beautiful motorcycles that were popular around the world. 
It cost a lot to make them in ths US, so the motorcycles were expensive. Problems began when 
other companies, in other countries, started making similar motorcycles. Company management 
decided they had two choices. One solution was to move the factory to a less expensive 
country. Another possibility was to have fewer workers in the factory and spend a lot of 
money on the latest technology to make the motorcycles.
