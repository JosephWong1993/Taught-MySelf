[JOAN]  So, what do you have for me?
[TODD]  Well, Simon and I had a good discussion. First, we don't want to lay anyone off.
[JOAN]  Mm-hmm.
[TODD]  Instead, we're proposing that the savings come in two areas. We've looked at current projects, 
        and we think we can delay the database project for six months.
[JOAN]  Okay. That sounds reasonable. How much would that save?
[TODD]  It would save about half a million dollars.
[JOAN]  Great. what else?
[TODD]  Well, we'd like to suggest a hiring freeze.
[JOAN]  For all departments?
[SIMON] Yes, but two of my engineers are leaving, and I'll need to replace one the them.
[JOAN]  OKay. What will that save us over the next six months?
[TODD]  Overall, I mean for all departmments, we should save the company around a million dollars.
[JOAN]  Good work, guys. What else?
[TODD]  Uh, That's it, for now.
[JOAN]  It's a good start, but we need to save more. I'm think about our rent. Our lease ends in six months. 
        I think that we should look at some different options.
[TODD]  I agree. I can start on that today.
[JOAN]  Great.

动词变为名词
一些动词加上后缀后可变为名词。一些能把动词变成名词的后缀是：-ion,-ing,-al,-ism,-ness,-ist和-ity。
discuss - discussion    //  讨论 - 讨论
suggest - suggestion    //  建议 - 建议
hire - hiring           //  聘请 - 雇用
save - savings          //  节省 - 储蓄
propose - proposal      //  提议 - 方案
有些名词看起来与他们的动词非常不同。如，think 的名词和该动词的过去式完全一样：
think - thought //  认为 - 想法
另一方面，有些名词与其动词形式相同。
delay - delay       //  推迟 - 推迟
start - start       //  开始 - 开始
lay off - layoff    //  解雇 - 解雇
语言点：动词变名词并没有固定的规则，不是所有动词都能变名词。你只需熟记这些不同的形式。

‘propose’和‘suggest’后的从句
用 propose 和 suggest 动词提出建议。注意，两个动词后常接一个 that 从句。
I propose that we dalay the database project.   //  我提议我们推迟数据库项目。
I suggest that we hire a new project manager.   //  我建议我们聘请一位新的项目经理。
that 可以省略，没有意义的变化。
I propose we delay the database project.        //  我提议我们推迟数据库项目。
I suggest we hire a new project manager.        //  我建议我们聘请一位新的项目经理。
两个动词 propose 和 suggest 说明可能性的概念，并且强调说话人即将要讲的内容。 注意两个动词之后始终使用不带 to 的不定式，
而且并不遵循主谓一致的规则。也就是说， he、she 或 it 后面的动词不需要加 -s 。
I propose that he delay the project.    //  我提议他推迟项目。
I suggest she lay off some staff.       //  我建议她应该裁掉一些人员。

She is very sick. I suggest she go to the doctor.
He proposes that the company not give pay increases this year.
We need to save money. I propose we delay the project.
Employee morale is important. I suggest that we not have any layoffs.
I propose that he hire one new engineer. We need the help.

RON:    OK, so what are your ideas for saving money?
LINDA:  Well, I have two proposals. First, I propose that we delay the database project for six months.
RON:    How much will that save us?
LINDA:  Half a million dollars.
RON:    That's great! And your second idea?
LINDA:  Well, I suggest that the company not lay off any staff, and that we have a hiring freeze.
        In other words, as staff leaves, we won't replace them.
RON:    Interesting.

I propose we wait a couple of months.   //  我提议我们等上几个月。
I propose that he delay the project.    //  我建议他推迟这个项目。
I suggest we have a hiring freeze.      //  我建议我们冻结招聘。

We're proposing that ...        //  我们计划。。。。。。
That sounds reasonable.         //  那听起来很合理。
What else?                      //  还有什么？
We'd like to suggest ...        //  我们想建议。。。。。。
Goods work, guys.               //  干得好，各位。
look at some different options  //  考察不同的方案
I agree.                        //  我同意

I think that sounds reasonable.
He suggests that we have a hiring freeze.
I'm proposing that we delay the project.
She suggested that we hire new staff.
I agree with you. It' a really good idea.
I really disagree. It't totally unreasonable.

I suggest that we have a hiring freeze.     //  我建议我们停止招聘。
We have to look at some different options.  //  我们必须考虑一些不同的方案。
I agree with you.                           //  我同意你。
