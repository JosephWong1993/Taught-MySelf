[TODD]  Oh, yes. That's a huge project.
[SIMON] In my opinion, we don't need it right now. We can wait six months.
[TODD]  How much will that save?
[SIMON] I believe we can save half a million dollars.
[TODD]  Half a million? That's fantastic.

[TODD]  OKay, What else?
[SIMON] We could delay the release of our new accounting software next year.
[TODD]  No, We can't do that. I've already promised our best customers that it's coming in about a year.
[TODD]  How many of your people are leaving in the next six months.
[SIMON] Uh, two that I know of. You're thinking of a hiring freeze, right?
