layoffs to save money               //  裁员来省钱

[JOAN]  The purpose of this meeting is to give you an update about IXW's purchase of Sunset 
        Computers. I know you must have a lot of questions. Well, now is the time for answers.
[JOAN]  Let's start with the good news. Due to the purchase of Sunset, our market share in 
        Asia has increased to 23 percent. And our revenue from the region has increased to 
        nearly 25 percent. This is mainly because of Sunset's strength in China and Korea.
[JOAN]  However, sales in Europe have decreased slightly. As a result, revenue there fell by 
        8 percent, while sales in North and South America have been flat. Overall, revenue is 
        up by 5 percent, but our costs have also risen. Consequently, our profits are going 
        to decrease slightly.
[JOAN]  Let me assure you, we're not looking at layoffs to save money. But it is possible 
        that we'll delay some projects. In the next few weeks, you will be working with your 
        managers to find opportunities to cut expenses. Does anyone have any questions?
