tardiness   //  迟到
late        //  晚的，迟的
flexibility //  灵活性

[TODO]  I asked you here to talk about your occasional tardiness.
[HAPPY] Oh, okay.
[TODO]  You see, it's becoming a bit of a problem. Sometimes you're as much as an hour late.
[HAPPY] I know.
[TODO]  So what's going on?
[HAPPY] I'm really sorry. I've been meaning to talk to you abot this.
[TODO]  Okay. So what's the story?
[HAPPY] Well, as you know, my wife's just got a new job.
[TODO]  Mm-hmm.
[HAPPY] And it's now me who drives the kids to school every morning. That's what's making me late.
[TODO]  I know how that is. I have two kids of my own. But regardless, we have to figure out a solution to this.
[HAPPY] I agree.
[TODO]  Another possibility would be for you to stay an hour in the evenings. 
        We have a lot of engineers who work late. They often have questions for us. You could deal with them. 
[TODO]  Would that work for you?
[HAPPY] Yeah, that would work. That would definitely work. Thanks, Todd. I appreciate your flexibility on this.
[TODO]  Let's try this for a couple of weeks, and see how it goes.
[HAPPY] Okay.
[TODO]  And I want to emphasize that we value your work. This isn't a big deal.
[HAPPY] Thaks, Todd.

//  工作问题
//  与生活中其他方面已有，有时工作中也会碰到一些问题。一位员工可能需要与老板就以下方面谈话：
being late = tardiness          //  迟到
being disorganized              //  缺乏条理的
being lazy                      //  懒惰
being sloppy                    //  粗心
being argumentative             //  好辩
being offensive                 //  无礼
not being flexible              //  处事不灵活
not following instructions      //  不遵守指示
not working well with the team  //  和团队合作不愉快
not meeting deadlines           //  没有如期完成

JOSH:   My boss wanted to speak with me today. And it wasn't very nice.
PAM:    What for?
JOSH:   For not meeting my deadline.
PAM:    Oh, no. I'm sorry.
JOSH:   Yeah, and also for being argumentative.
PAM:    Really? Well, you are a bit argumentative - sometimes.
JOSH:   Me? Argumentative? No way! I am not.
PAM:    You see?
JOSH:   What?
PAM:    Did your boss mention anything else?
JOSH:   Uh, yeah. He said I need to work on being more flexible.
PAM:    Yeah ... Good luck with that.

She spoke to me about my tardiness.                 //  她跟我谈了谈我的迟到问题。
I have to stop being so disorganized.               //  我必须不能再缺乏条理了。
He's not working well with the team.                //  他和团队协作的并不好。
She was warned about not being flexible enough.     //  她因为处事不够灵活被警告了。
Being argumentative at work is not a good thing.    //  工作中爱争论不是好事。
Sorry! I wasn't following instructions.             //  对不起！我没有遵照指示。
He was fired for being offensive.                   //  他因为无礼被解雇了。
Not meeting deadlines is unacceptable.              //  不能按时完成工作是不能接受的。

//  含who的关系从句
Frank is someone who enjoys a cup of coffee.    //  Frank是一个喜欢喝咖啡的人。
Oscar is someone who enjoys a practical joke.   //  Oscar是一个喜欢开玩笑的人。
//  ‘who’引导的关系从句
//  用关系从句连接两个句子。关系从句使您的写作和讲话更流利，并帮助您避免重复。关系代词who用来指人。
We have a lot of engineers. The engineers work late.
We have a lot of engineers who work late.
//  在例子中，主句We have a lot of engineers是一个完整的句子。关系从句who worl late 不是一个完整的句子，故不能独立成句。

You wouldn't believe the people I work with. I have a colleague who never cleans his desk. He is so sloppy. 
I have a manager who enjoys being offensive. It's just awful. 
And I have a boss who is never in the office. She's so lazy, it's incredible.

I have a colleague. The colleague is very sloppy.   //  我有一个同事。这个同事做事非常马虎。
I have a colleague who is very sloppy.              //  我有一个做事非常马虎的同事。
I work with a guy. He never meets deadlines.        //  我和一个人共事。他从不按时完成工作。
I work with a guy who never meets deadlines.        //  我和一个从不按时完成工作的人共事。
I have a new boss. She isn't very flexible.         //  我有一个新老板。她处室不是非常灵活。
I have a new boos who isn't very flexible.          //  我有一个处事不是非常灵活的新老板。

So what's going on?                 //  那么，发生什么事了？
What's the story?                   //  怎么回事？
We have to figure out a solution.   //  我们必须想出解决的办法。
Another possibility would be ...    //  另一种可能是。。。。。。
Would that work for you?            //  你觉得这可行吗？
Yeah, that would work.              //  对，这可行
Let's see how it goes.              //  让我们看看会怎么样？

LARRY:  Come in. Ah, Pamela. Thank you for coming. Have a seat.
PAMELA: No proble. What's up?
LARRY:  I asked you here today to talk about the team.
PAMELA: What about the team?
LARRY:  Well, I know you're a hard worker, but Paul told me that you don't work well with the team. 
        He says you're argumentative. This is something we have to deal with. What's the story?
PAMELA: Execuse me, but Paul is offensive to all the women on the team.
LARRY:  Okay. How is he offensive?
PAMELA: He's always making bad jokes about women. And last week, he called Anna fat. He's just so rude. 
        You can ask any woman on the team.
LARRY:  Really? Well, we have to figure out a solution for this.
PAMELA: One solution could be for you to talk to the team as a group, not just Paul or me.
LARRY:  I think that's a good idea. Would tomorrow work for you?
PAMELA: Yes, Thank you very much.

What's going on?                                    //  怎么回事？
What's the story?                                   //  怎么回事？
This is something that we have to deal with.        //  这事我们必须得处理。
We have to figure out a solution for this.          //  我们必须想出一个解决办法来处理这件事。
One solution could be that I come early.            //  一种可能的解决方法就是我来早点。
No, I don't think so.                               //  不，我不这样想。
Another possibility would be for me to work late.   //  另一种可能就是我晚点走。
That would work.                                    //  那可行。
Let's see how it goes.                              //  让我们看看会怎么样？
